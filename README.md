# Wine Quality
The dataset consists of chemical properties of wine such as acidity, alcohol content, pH, and more, with the goal of understanding how these factors influence wine quality. 
# Here's what I explored:

**Wine Quality Distribution by Alcohol Levels**  🧪: Analyzed how wine quality varies across different levels of alcohol using violin plots.

**Acidity's Effect on Quality** 🔬: Investigated both fixed and volatile acidity to uncover trends between acidity levels and average quality scores.

**Correlations & Patterns** 🔗: Used heatmaps and pair plots to identify significant relationships between chemical features and wine quality.

**Outlier Detection** 🚨: Checked for outliers in key features like volatile acidity and residual sugar that might impact quality.

This project gave me valuable insights into how data can reveal the secrets behind wine composition and its quality! 🍇
